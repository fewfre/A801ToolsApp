You can move the folder this program is in where ever you want,
but moving ONLY this exe WILL cause an error.

The folder is standalone (it won't break if you move it),
and can safely be moved where ever; be it documents, desktop,
or any out of the way folder of your choice.

You can create a shortcut / pin to start menu if you want, or
you can just manually go to where you move this folder and run it manually.
